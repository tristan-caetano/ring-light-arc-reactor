# ring-light-arc-reactor
Using a small arduino a program a small ringlight to look like an arc reactor so I can dress up as Tony Stark from Iron Man 1 for a Halloween party thats like 3 days from when I created this repository. I hope I can figure it out.

## Update:
I was able to figure it out in time, it was cool.
